This command shows a history of all rename operations, including:
- Original and new file names
- Timestamp when the operation was performed  
- Whether the operation has been reverted
- Media information that was used for the rename

Examples:
  # List all rename operations
  goname state ls
  
  # List only active (non-reverted) operations
  goname state ls --active
  
  # List only the last 10 operations
  goname state ls --limit 10`,
